  Our project is inspired by The New York Times Spelling Bee. The original game 
  gives the player a board of seven letters (displayed as a hexagon, or "hex", 
  with six letters on each corner and one in the center). The player should 
  attempt to produce as many words as possible using the provided letters, but 
  each word must contain the center letter. Letters may be repeated.

  Our game implements this using both a GUI and the terminal. The game is run in 
  the GUI at the beginning and the player is given a choice of using the base 
  version of the original game in the GUI, or continuing in the command line with
  additional features.

  The command line version integrates new implementations of board
  shapes (using multiple hexes). Note that if playing on a multi-hex board, a 
  word can only be composed using one of the integrated hexes. This version also 
  involves different commands, all accessible via "#help". At the start of the 
  game, the player is prompted to enter both a Game Name and a Player Name. 
  Using the "#save" command, the data for this particular game and player can 
  be saved, and later reloaded by entering the same Game Name and Player Name at 
  the start of the new game.

  In both implementations, players get one point for four letter words and one
  point per letter for longer words, with pangrams being the exception. A 
  "pangram" is a word that contains all of the letters in the hex, and earns 
  the player an additional seven points for the word. Players are given a ranking 
  throughout the game based on the difficulty of the board they are on.
